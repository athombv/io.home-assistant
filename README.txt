Many are switching from Home Assistant to Homey, and with good reason. Homey is easier to use, looks beautiful and supports many more brands & features.

However, making the switch is quite some effort! Especially when you have quite a big smart home.

This app helps you smoothen the transition by controlling your existing Home Assistant devices from Homey. You can then migrate them over at your own pace.
