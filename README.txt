The Home Assistant app for Homey makes it easy for you to add Home Assistant integrations to Homey by connecting their devices. 

Support for Home Assistant devices with Light, Sensor, Binary sensor, Cover and Media player entities. The Home Assistant App for Homey lets you control these entities via the Homey Mobile App, Homey Web App as well as voice assistants (Google Assistant and Alexa).

Please note that it is only possible to add entities which are part of a Home Assistant device, it is not possible to add separate entities. 

For this integration Homey needs to connect to your Home Assistant instance, either through a static local IP and port (Homey Pro), port forwarding or remote access through a proxy service.
